Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn\\u2019t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn\\u2019t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger\\u2019s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it\\u2019s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can\\u2019t be termed as thin or delicate too. It\\u2019s not the thickest I\\u2019ve seen but then thickest doesn\\u2019t always means most durable. Given my application it\\u2019s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"img_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1412,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51esjcOy79L._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\",\n          \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nRBNNDnNL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\",\n          \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31-hWNXDxiL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1465,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Snapdragon-Resolution-Refresh-27-81Cm-Display/dp/B09XXZXQC1/ref=sr_1_437?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-437\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Skadioo-Accessories-Receiver-Compatible-dongle/dp/B09LHXNZLR/ref=sr_1_195?qid=1672909134&s=electronics&sr=1-195\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/LOHAYA-Assistant-Compatible-Xstream-Function/dp/B09LV13JFB/ref=sr_1_408?qid=1672909144&s=electronics&sr=1-408\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"specific_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DigitalScales\",\n          \"StreamingClients\",\n          \"RechargeableBatteries\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1347,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Canon E4570 All-in-One Wi-Fi Ink Efficient Colour Printer with FAX/ADF/Duplex Printing (Black)- Smart Speaker Compatible, Standard Computers&Accessories|Printers,Inks&Accessories|Printers|InkjetPrinters Printer Type- Ink Efficient, Functionality - All-in-One (Print, Scan, Copy, Fax); Printer Output - Color; Connectivity - Wi-Fi, Wi-fi Direct, USB, Canon Selphy App; Scanner Resolution - 600 x 1200dpi; Apple Airprint - Yes|OS Compatibility - Windows 10 / 8.1 / 7 SP1 (operation can only be guaranteed on a PC with a pre-installed Windows 7 or later) macOS v10.13.6 ~ 11.0 Chrome OS; Duplex - Auto; Enlarge/reduce option - No; Mobile connectivity - Yes|Maximum Print Speed (color) - 4.4 ppm, Maximum Print Speed (Monochrome) - 8.8 ppm; Print cost Monochrome - 1.8; Print cost color - 4.5; Maximum Print Resolution - 4800 X 1200 dpi|Max paper thickness -64 to 275 GSM; Smart Speaker compatible; Power wattage of printer - OFF: 0.3W, Standby (scanning lamp is off) (USB connection to PC): 0.8 W, Copying (USB connection to PC): 7W|Ideal usage - Home and Small Office, Regular usage (200 prints per month); Included Components - Printer, Power cord, 1set of PG47 & CL57s ink cartridge, user manual, installation CD, USB cable|Print yield is based on the consumption data from the succeeding ink cartridge and not the first ink cartridge.

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn\\u2019t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn\\u2019t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger\\u2019s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it\\u2019s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can\\u2019t be termed as thin or delicate too. It\\u2019s not the thickest I\\u2019ve seen but then thickest doesn\\u2019t always means most durable. Given my application it\\u2019s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"img_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1696513338863-e3cf828d237d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3MjU1NzR8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDI0NjEwMzJ8&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080\",\n          \"https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photo-of-a-diagnostic-medical-tool-10996741/\",\n          \"https://pixabay.com/get/g4b7f678385f88be7b41af5b58b65e75b0ae0db9d7e4696783d7d222814517d454af5b9ffbf92252f6198d2e9ebb7c03929052294a5b1c423342f50d9adeb1194_640.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1465,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Snapdragon-Resolution-Refresh-27-81Cm-Display/dp/B09XXZXQC1/ref=sr_1_437?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-437\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Skadioo-Accessories-Receiver-Compatible-dongle/dp/B09LHXNZLR/ref=sr_1_195?qid=1672909134&s=electronics&sr=1-195\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/LOHAYA-Assistant-Compatible-Xstream-Function/dp/B09LV13JFB/ref=sr_1_408?qid=1672909144&s=electronics&sr=1-408\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"specific_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DigitalScales\",\n          \"StreamingClients\",\n          \"RechargeableBatteries\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1347,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Canon E4570 All-in-One Wi-Fi Ink Efficient Colour Printer with FAX/ADF/Duplex Printing (Black)- Smart Speaker Compatible, Standard Computers&Accessories|Printers,Inks&Accessories|Printers|InkjetPrinters Printer Type- Ink Efficient, Functionality - All-in-One (Print, Scan, Copy, Fax); Printer Output - Color; Connectivity - Wi-Fi, Wi-fi Direct, USB, Canon Selphy App; Scanner Resolution - 600 x 1200dpi; Apple Airprint - Yes|OS Compatibility - Windows 10 / 8.1 / 7 SP1 (operation can only be guaranteed on a PC with a pre-installed Windows 7 or later) macOS v10.13.6 ~ 11.0 Chrome OS; Duplex - Auto; Enlarge/reduce option - No; Mobile connectivity - Yes|Maximum Print Speed (color) - 4.4 ppm, Maximum Print Speed (Monochrome) - 8.8 ppm; Print cost Monochrome - 1.8; Print cost color - 4.5; Maximum Print Resolution - 4800 X 1200 dpi|Max paper thickness -64 to 275 GSM; Smart Speaker compatible; Power wattage of printer - OFF: 0.3W, Standby (scanning lamp is off) (USB connection to PC): 0.8 W, Copying (USB connection to PC): 7W|Ideal usage - Home and Small Office, Regular usage (200 prints per month); Included Components - Printer, Power cord, 1set of PG47 & CL57s ink cartridge, user manual, installation CD, USB cable|Print yield is based on the consumption data from the succeeding ink cartridge and not the first ink cartridge.

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn\\u2019t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn\\u2019t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger\\u2019s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it\\u2019s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can\\u2019t be termed as thin or delicate too. It\\u2019s not the thickest I\\u2019ve seen but then thickest doesn\\u2019t always means most durable. Given my application it\\u2019s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"img_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1105,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pixabay.com/get/g18a779c715baa6c7e17869f54a519c5f31bd668e3c10d82d851dc29d298adccb69559ec9bff75e719daff2e3200ebf2db40f409c6ff123e883512bef969959a1_640.jpg\",\n          \"https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photo-of-white-plastic-pitcher-14207017/\",\n          \"https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-focus-photography-of-3-kingston-sandisk-adapter-175449/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1465,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Snapdragon-Resolution-Refresh-27-81Cm-Display/dp/B09XXZXQC1/ref=sr_1_437?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-437\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/Skadioo-Accessories-Receiver-Compatible-dongle/dp/B09LHXNZLR/ref=sr_1_195?qid=1672909134&s=electronics&sr=1-195\",\n          \"https://www.amazon.in/LOHAYA-Assistant-Compatible-Xstream-Function/dp/B09LV13JFB/ref=sr_1_408?qid=1672909144&s=electronics&sr=1-408\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"specific_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DigitalScales\",\n          \"StreamingClients\",\n          \"RechargeableBatteries\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1347,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Canon E4570 All-in-One Wi-Fi Ink Efficient Colour Printer with FAX/ADF/Duplex Printing (Black)- Smart Speaker Compatible, Standard Computers&Accessories|Printers,Inks&Accessories|Printers|InkjetPrinters Printer Type- Ink Efficient, Functionality - All-in-One (Print, Scan, Copy, Fax); Printer Output - Color; Connectivity - Wi-Fi, Wi-fi Direct, USB, Canon Selphy App; Scanner Resolution - 600 x 1200dpi; Apple Airprint - Yes|OS Compatibility - Windows 10 / 8.1 / 7 SP1 (operation can only be guaranteed on a PC with a pre-installed Windows 7 or later) macOS v10.13.6 ~ 11.0 Chrome OS; Duplex - Auto; Enlarge/reduce option - No; Mobile connectivity - Yes|Maximum Print Speed (color) - 4.4 ppm, Maximum Print Speed (Monochrome) - 8.8 ppm; Print cost Monochrome - 1.8; Print cost color - 4.5; Maximum Print Resolution - 4800 X 1200 dpi|Max paper thickness -64 to 275 GSM; Smart Speaker compatible; Power wattage of printer - OFF: 0.3W, Standby (scanning lamp is off) (USB connection to PC): 0.8 W, Copying (USB connection to PC): 7W|Ideal usage - Home and Small Office, Regular usage (200 prints per month); Included Components - Printer, Power cord, 1set of PG47 & CL57s ink cartridge, user manual, installation CD, USB cable|Print yield is based on the consumption data from the succeeding ink cartridge and not the first ink cartridge.
